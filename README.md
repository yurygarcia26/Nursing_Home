Effect of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to Contain the Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Nursing Homes 


Current COVID-19 interventions for nursing homes focus on limitation of visitors, staff rescheduling, social distancing, and effective isolation of symptomatic people. All interventions are potentially thwarted by a long period of pre-symptomatic infectivity. In the absence of a vaccine, our model showed these non-pharmaceutical interventions were effective in reducing the speed of the initial spread and the number of concurrent infections. While reducing the potential to
overwhelm nursing homes and other health-care services, such levels of performance do not ultimately reduce the attack or mortality rates, except in the presence of high isolation of pre-symptomatic carriers. In nursing homes and other congregate settings, infection control measures require identifying most infections prior to symptom progression to effectively manage an outbreak.

Steps to follow:

   1. Run script named: Simulate_scenarios.m
   2. Save files in a folder named Data
   3. Run files step1_CreateMatrix.m and step2_CreateMatrixxlsFormat.m to get a .xlsx file with information for tables and plots
